### Saying goodbye to GitHub 

My account has been migrated from GitHub to Codeberg. GitHub is owned by Microsoft and uses source code on GitHub for AI training without developers' consent. To put it mildly, it's the worst to see them freeloading off the work of both large corporations and small developers to make money, and I want no part of it. That's why I decided to migrate to Codeberg. There's no doubt that GitHub remains the leading git hosting platform due to its network effects. However, if you share my values, I recommend migrating to Codeberg.
